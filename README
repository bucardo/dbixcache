REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

    build, test, and install Perl 5         (at least 5.6.1)
    build, test, and install the DBI module (at least 1.52)
    build, test, and install Test::Simple   (at least 0.47)

INSTALLATION:
-------------

Before installing, please use the "cpansign -v" program to cryptographically 
verify that your copy of DBIx::Cache is complete and valid. The program 
"cpansign" is part of Module::Signature, available from CPAN.

The usual steps to install DBIx::Cache are:

    1.   perl Makefile.PL
    2.   make
    3.   make test
    4.   make install

Do steps 1 to 3 as a normal user, not as root!

TESTING:
--------

The tests are not very useful without a database to connect to. 
Currently, only Postgres, via the DBD::Pg driver, is supported.

The DBD::Pg tests rely on being able to connect to a valid Postgres database. 
The easiest way to ensure this is to set the following environment variables:

    DBI_DSN=dbi:Pg:dbname=<database>
    DBI_USER=<username>
    DBI_PASS=<password>

If you are running on a non-standard port, you must set PGPORT or 
add the port to the DBI_DSN variable like this:

    DBI_DSN='dbi:Pg:dbname=<database>;port=<port#>'

Put double quotes around the dbname if it has a semicolon 
or a space inside of it:

    DBI_DSN='dbi:Pg:dbname="<data;base>"'

You can increase the verbosity of the tests by setting the 
environment variable TEST_VERBOSE.

When reporting test failures, please use TEST_VERBOSE=1

Please consider installing CPAN::Reporter so that your tests are 
automatically gathered and reported, which helps the development 
of DBIx::Cache.
